                        <h3>Background</h3>
                        <p>Malaysia Airlines flight 370 was a flight going from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. On March 8, 2014, the plane disappeared over the Indian Ocean. It left Kuala Lumpur at 12:41 A.M. The data reporter and location transponder shut off at 1:07 and 1:21 A.M. respectively. At 2:40 A.M. air traffic control lost contact with the plane. We’re not sure what happened after that. Pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah might have hijacked the plane, or it could have been a Russian passenger, or a US surveillance aircraft. All of these theories are far-fetched, though, and have little evidence to support it. The plane was diverted off its path by a lot. It was supposed to be heading north, but it turned sharply southwest and then northwest again.</p>

                    <h3>Suspect 1</h3>
                    <h3>Zaharie Ahmad Shah- Pilot</h3>
                     <p>He may have committed suicide because his wife left him</p>
                       <p>Evidence- He had made no social plans after March 8, and the plane flew past the island of his birth, which might be because he wanted to look at it one last time.</p>
                        </p>

                <h3>Suspect 2</h3>
                <h3>US Surveillance Aircraft</h3>
                 <p>MH370 was near a US military base in the Indian Ocean, and it might have been shot down because the surveillance aircraft was afraid of a 9/11 style attack</p>
                   <p>There is no credible evidence, but the theory hasn’t been ruled out.</p>
                    </p>

            <h3>Suspect 3</h3>
            <h3>Technical Problems</h3>
             <p>This is the most likely theory, as it doesn’t depend on human behavior. Something like rapid decompression could have incapacitated the pilots. They may have jerked to the side multiple times, inciting the direction change.</p>

        <h3>What Happened?</h3>
        <p>I feel that the most plausible explanation is that the plane rapidly depressurized because of an unprecedented issue with the plane. If the plane depressurized, everyone on board would be killed, but the plane would keep flying if it was on autopilot. When the pilots were knocked unconscious, they may have jerked to the side multiple times, inciting the direction change.</p>
        <h3>Evidence</h3>
         <p>The plane was diverted off its path by a lot. It was supposed to be heading north, but it turned sharply southwest and then northwest again. </p>
          <p>  The plane was working for six hours after going missing, until it ran out of fuel. </p>
           <p> Audio recordings of the pilots do exist, and in them they seemed confident, like nothing was going to go wrong. </p>

            <h3>Alternate Theory</h3>
            <h3>Another theory is that the plane was hijacked by the US and taken to the Diego Garcia base in the Indian Ocean.</h3>
             <h4>This probably didn’t happen for two reasons.</h4>
               <p>Why would a major power have any reason to hijack a seemingly normal civilian flight?</p>
                <p>Debris that washed up on the eastern coast of Africa shows that the plane did crash in the Southern Indian Ocean. </p>
                <h6>Then again, it could all just be a cover up…</h5>
